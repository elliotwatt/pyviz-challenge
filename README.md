San Fransisco Housing Market Analysis
</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
Objective:
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My goal was to analyze the housing market in San Fransisco to give a client insights into 
potential investments in the area. I did this by creating interactive charts showing:
housing units change per year, sales price and rental income change per year, and sales price
and rental income change per year by neighborhood. Finally, I created a map that shows the 
data over the neighborhoods so the client can use their one-click service to buy and rent 
properties
